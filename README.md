## About Me

I am a software engineer interested in tackling problems on both sides of the stack and have deployed several applications taking advantage of several frameworks and languages. I am currently seeking employment and am always looking for opportunities to connect with other engineers in the community.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rvcwhitworth/rvcwhitworth.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
